         "Mr. Smith, Mr. Nixon. In the election of 1860, Abraham Lincoln said the question was whether this nation could exist half-slave or half-free. In the election of 1960, and with the world around us, the question is whether the world will exist half-slave or half-free, whether it will move in the direction of freedom, in the direction of the road that we are taking, or whether it will move in the direction of slavery. I think it will depend in great measure upon what we do here in the United States, on the kind of society that we build, on the kind of strength that we maintain. We discuss tonight domestic issues, but I would not want that to be any implication to be given that this does not involve directly our struggle with Mr. Khrushchev for survival. Mr. Khrushchev is in New York, and he maintains the Communist offensive throughout the world because of the productive power of the Soviet Union itself. The Chinese Communists have always had a large population. But they are important and dangerous now because they are mounting a major effort within their own country. The kind of country we have here, the kind of society we have, the kind of strength we build in the United States will be the defense of freedom. If we do well here, if we meet our obligations, if were moving ahead, then I think freedom will be secure around the world. If we fail, then freedom fails. Therefore, I think the question before the American people is: Are we doing as much as we can do? Are we as strong as we should be? Are we as strong as we must be if were going to maintain our independence, and if were going to maintain and hold out the hand of friendship to those who look to us for assistance, to those who look to us for survival? I should make it very clear that I do not think were doing enough, that I am not satisfied as an American with the progress that were making. This is a great country, but I think it could be a greater country; and this is a powerful country, but I think it could be a more powerful country. Im not satisfied to have fifty percent of our steel-mill capacity unused. Im not satisfied when the United States had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world. Because economic growth means strength and vitality; it means were able to sustain our defenses; it means were able to meet our commitments abroad. Im not satisfied when we have over nine billion dollars worth of food  some of it rotting  even though there is a hungry world, and even though four million Americans wait every month for a food package from the government, which averages five cents a day per individual. I saw cases in West Virginia, here in the United States, where children took home part of their school lunch in order to feed their families because I dont think were meeting our obligations toward these Americans. Im not satisfied when the Soviet Union is turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as we are. Im not satisfied when many of our teachers are inadequately paid, or when our children go to school part-time shifts. I think we should have an educational system second to none. Im not satisfied when I see men like Jimmy Hoffa  in charge of the largest union in the United States  still free. Im not satisfied when we are failing to develop the natural resources of the United States to the fullest. Here in the United States, which developed the Tennessee Valley and which built the Grand Coulee and the other dams in the Northwest United States at the present rate of hydropower production  and that is the hallmark of an industrialized society  the Soviet Union by 1975 will be producing more power than we are. These are all the things, I think, in this country that can make our society strong, or can mean that it stands still. Im not satisfied until every American enjoys his full constitutional rights. If a Negro baby is born  and this is true also of Puerto Ricans and Mexicans in some of our cities  he has about one-half as much chance to get through high school as a white baby. He has one-third as much chance to get through college as a white student. He has about a third as much chance to be a professional man, about half as much chance to own a house. He has about uh  four times as much chance that hell be out of work in his life as the white baby. I think we can do better. I dont want the talents of any American to go to waste. I know that there are those who want to turn everything over to the government. I dont at all. I want the individuals to meet their responsibilities. And I want the states to meet their responsibilities. But I think there is also a national responsibility. The argument has been used against every piece of social legislation in the last twenty-five years. The people of the United States individually could not have developed the Tennessee Valley; collectively they could have. A cotton farmer in Georgia or a peanut farmer or a dairy farmer in Wisconsin and Minnesota, he cannot protect himself against the forces of supply and demand in the market place; but working together in effective governmental programs he can do so. Seventeen million Americans, who live over sixty-five on an average Social Security check of about seventy-eight dollars a month, theyre not able to sustain themselves individually, but they can sustain themselves through the social security system. I dont believe in big government, but I believe in effective governmental action. And I think thats the only way that the United States is going to maintain its freedom. Its the only way that were going to move ahead. I think we can do a better job. I think were going to have to do a better job if we are going to meet the responsibilities which time and events have placed upon us. We cannot turn the job over to anyone else. If the United States fails, then the whole cause of freedom fails. And I think it depends in great measure on what we do here in this country. The reason Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor in the United States. Because they felt that the American society was moving again. I want us to recapture that image. I want people in Latin America and Africa and Asia to start to look to America; to see how were doing things; to wonder what the resident of the United States is doing; and not to look at Khrushchev, or look at the Chinese Communists. That is the obligation upon our generation. In 1933, Franklin Roosevelt said in his inaugural that this generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny. I think our generation of Americans has the same rendezvous. The question now is: Can freedom be maintained under the most severe tack  attack it has ever known? I think it can be. And I think in the final analysis it depends upon what we do here. I think its time America started moving again.",

         "Mr. Smith, Senator Kennedy. The things that Senator Kennedy has said many of us can agree with. There is no question but that we cannot discuss our internal affairs in the United States without recognizing that they have a tremendous bearing on our international position. There is no question but that this nation cannot stand still; because we are in a deadly competition, a competition not only with the men in the Kremlin, but the men in Peking. Were ahead in this competition, as Senator Kennedy, I think, has implied. But when youre in a race, the only way to stay ahead is to move ahead. And I subscribe completely to the spirit that Senator Kennedy has expressed tonight, the spirit that the United States should move ahead. Where, then, do we disagree? I think we disagree on the implication of his remarks tonight and on the statements that he has made on many occasions during his campaign to the effect that the United States has been standing still. We heard tonight, for example, the statement made that our growth in national product last year was the lowest of any industrial nation in the world. Now last year, of course, was 1958. That happened to be a recession year. But when we look at the growth of G.N.P. this year, a year of recovery, we find that its six and nine-tenths per cent and one of the highest in the world today. More about that later. Looking then to this problem of how the United States should move ahead and where the United States is moving, I think it is well that we take the advice of a very famous campaigner: Lets look at the record. Is the United States standing still? Is it true that this Administration, as Senator Kennedy has charged, has been an Administration of retreat, of defeat, of stagnation? Is it true that, as far as this country is concerned, in the field of electric power, in all of the fields that he has mentioned, we have not been moving ahead. Well, we have a comparison that we can make. We have the record of the Truman Administration of seven and a half years and the seven and a half years of the Eisenhower Administration. When we compare these two records in the areas that Senator Kennedy has  has discussed tonight, I think we find that America has been moving ahead. Lets take schools. We have built more schools in these last seven and a half years than we built in the previous seven and a half, for that matter in the previous twenty years. Lets take hydroelectric power. We have developed more hydroelectric power in these seven and a half years than was developed in any previous administration in history. Let us take hospitals. We find that more have been built in this Administration than in the previous Administration. The same is true of highways. Lets put it in terms that all of us can understand. We often hear gross national product discussed and in that respect may I say that when we compare the growth in this Administration with that of the previous Administration that then there was a total growth of eleven percent over seven years; in this Administration there has been a total growth of nineteen per cent over seven years. That shows that theres been more growth in this Administration than in its predecessor. But lets not put it there; lets put it in terms of the average family. What has happened to you? We find that your wages have gone up five times as much in the Eisenhower Administration as they did in the Truman Administration. What about the prices you pay? We find that the prices you pay went up five times as much in the Truman Administration as they did in the Eisenhower Administration. Whats the net result of this? This means that the average family income went up fifteen per cent in the Eisenhower years as against two per cent in the Truman years. Now, this is not standing still. But, good as this record is, may I emphasize it isnt enough. A record is never something to stand on. Its something to build on. And in building on this record, I believe that we have the secret for progress, we know the way to progress. And I think, first of all, our own record proves that we know the way. Senator Kennedy has suggested that he believes he knows the way. I respect the sincerity which he m- which he makes that suggestion. But on the other hand, when we look at the various programs that he offers, they do not seem to be new. They seem to be simply retreads of the programs of the Truman Administration which preceded it. And I would suggest that during the course of the evening he might indicate those areas in which his programs are new, where they will mean more progress than we had then. What kind of programs are we for? We are for programs that will expand educational opportunities, that will give to all Americans their equal chance for education, for all of the things which are necessary and dear to the hearts of our people. We are for programs, in addition, which will see that our medical care for the aged are  is  are much  is much better handled than it is at the present time. Here again, may I indicate that Senator Kennedy and I are not in disagreement as to the aims. We both want to help the old people. We want to see that they do have adequate medical care. The question is the means. I think that the means that I advocate will reach that goal better than the means that he advocates. I could give better examples, but for  for whatever it is, whether its in the field of housing, or health, or medical care, or schools, or the eh- development of electric power, we have programs which we believe will move America, move her forward and build on the wonderful record that we have made over these past seven and a half years. Now, when we look at these programs, might I suggest that in evaluating them we often have a tendency to say that the test of a program is how much youre spending. I will concede that in all the areas to which I have referred Senator Kennedy would have the spe- federal government spend more than I would have it spend. I costed out the cost of the Democratic platform. It runs a minimum of thirteen and two-tenths billions dollars a year more than we are presently spending to a maximum of eighteen billion dollars a year more than were presently spending. Now the Republican platform will cost more too. It will cost a minimum of four billion dollars a year more, a maximum of four and nine-tenths billion dollar a year more than were presently spending. Now, does this mean that his program is better than ours? Not at all. Because it isnt a question of how much the federal government spends; it isnt a question of which government does the most. It is a question of which administration does the right thing. And in our case, I do believe that our programs will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million free Americans. I believe the programs that Senator Kennedy advocates will have a tendency to stifle those creative energies, I believe in other words, that his program would lead to the stagnation of the motive power that we need in this country to get progress. The final point that I would like to make is this: Senator Kennedy has suggested in his speeches that we lack compassion for the poor, for the old, and for others that are unfortunate. Let us understand throughout this campaign that his motives and mine are sincere. I know what it means to be poor. I know what it means to see people who are unemployed. I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do, but our disagreement is not about the goals for America but only about the means to reach those goals.",

After my trip to South America, I made recommendations that a separate inter-American lending agency be set up which the South American nations would like much better than a lend- than to participate in the lending agencies which treated all the countries of the world the same. Uh  I have made other recommendations after each of the other trips; for example, after my trip abroad to Hungary I made some recommendations with regard to the Hungarian refugee situation which were adopted, not only by the President but some of them were enacted into law by the Congress. Within the Administration, as a chairman of the Presidents Committee on Price Stability and Economic Growth, I have had the opportunity to make recommendations which have been adopted within the Administration and which I think have been reasonably effective. I know Senator Kennedy suggested in his speech at Cleveland yesterday that that committee had not been particularly effective.

I prefer to take the overall percentage record of the last twenty years of the Democrats and the eight years of the Republicans to show an overall period of growth. In regard to uh  price stability uh  Im not aware that that committee did produce recommendations that ever were certainly before the Congress from the point of view of legislation in regard to controlling prices. In regard to the exchange of students and labor unions, I am chairman of the subcommittee on Africa and I think that one of the most unfortunate phases of our policy towards that country was the very minute number of exchanges that we had. I think its true of Latin America also. We did come forward with a program of students for the Congo of over three hundred which was more than the federal government had for all of Africa the previous year, so that I dont think that uh  we have moved at least in those two areas with sufficient vigor.",

         "Well, because I think that if the federal government moved out of the program and withdrew its supports uh  then I think you would have complete uh  economic chaos. The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall. There are hundreds of thousands of them. They really dont  theyre not able to control their market very well. They bring their crops in or their livestock in, many of them about the same time. They have only a few purchasers that buy their milk or their hogs  a few large companies in many cases  and therefore the farmer is not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place. I think the experience of the twenties has shown what a free market could do to agriculture. And if the agricultural economy collapses, then the economy of the rest of the United States sooner or later will collapse. The farmers are the number one market for the automobile industry of the United States. The automobile industry is the number one market for steel. So if the farmers economy continues to decline as sharply as it has in recent years, then I think you would have a recession in the rest of the country. So I think the case for the government intervention is a good one. Secondly, my objection to present farm policy is that there are no effective controls to bring supply and demand into better balance. The dropping of the support price in order to limit production does not work, and we now have the highest uh  surpluses  nine billion dollars worth. Weve had a uh  higher tax load from the Treasury for the farmer in the last few years with the lowest farm income in many years. I think that this farm policy has failed. In my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance. And that can only be done through governmental action. I therefore suggest that in those basic commodities which are supported, that the federal government, after endorsement by the farmers in that commodity, attempt to bring supply and demand into balance  attempt effective production controls  so that we wont have that five or six per cent surplus which breaks the price fifteen or twenty per cent. I think Mr. Bensons program has failed. And I must say, after reading the Vice Presidents speech before the farmers, as he read mine, I dont believe that its very much different from Mr. Bensons. I dont think it provides effective governmental controls. I think the support prices are tied to the average market price of the last three years, which was Mr. Bensons theory. I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future.",

He has made the suggestion that what we need is to move in the direction of more government controls, a suggestion that would also mean raising prices uh  that the consumers pay for products and im- and imposing upon the farmers uh  controls on acreage even far more than they have today. I think this is the wrong direction. I dont think this has worked in the past; I do not think it will work in the future. The program that I have advocated is one which departs from the present program that we have in this respect. It recognizes that the government has a responsibility to get the farmer out of the trouble he presently is in because the government got him into it. And thats the fundamental reason why we cant let the farmer go by himself at the present time. The farmer produced these surpluses because the government asked him to through legislation during the war. Now that we have these surpluses, its our responsibility to indemnify the farmer during that period that we get rid of the farmer uh  the surpluses. Until we get the surpluses off the farmers back, however, we should have a program such as I announced, which will see that farm income holds up. But I would propose holding that income up not through a type of program that Senator Kennedy has suggested that would raise prices, but one that would indemnify the farmer, pay the farmer in kind uh  from the products which are in surplus.",

Now, I can only say this. Through the years I have sat in the National Security Council. I have been in the cabinet. I have met with the legislative leaders. I have met with the President when he made the great decisions with regard to Lebanon, Quemoy and Matsu, other matters. The President has asked for my advice. I have given it. Sometimes my advice has been taken. Sometimes it has not. I do not say that I have made the decisions. And I would say that no president should ever allow anybody else to make the major decisions, The president only makes the decisions. All that his advisers do is to give counsel when he asks for it. As far as what experience counts and whether that is experience that counts, that isnt for me to say. Uh  I can only say that my experience is there for the people to consider; Senator Kennedys is there for the people to consider. As he pointed out, we came to the Congress in the same year.

         " reducing the interest rate. In my judgment, the hard money, tight money policy, fiscal policy of this Administration has contributed to the slow-down in our economy, which helped bring the recession of fifty-four; which made the recession of fifty-eight rather intense, and which has slowed, somewhat, our economic activity in 1960. What I have talked about, however, the kind of programs that Ive talked about, in my judgment, are uh  fiscally sound. Medical care for the aged, I would put under social security. The Vice President and I disagree on this. The program  the Javits-Nixon or the Nixon-Javits program  would have cost, if fully used uh  six hundred million dollars by the government per year, and six hundred million dollars by the state. The program which I advocated, which failed by five votes in the United States Senate, would have put medical care for the aged in Social Security, and would have been paid for through the Social Security System and the Social Security tax. Secondly, I support federal aid to education and federal aid for teachers salaries. I think thats a good investment. I think were going to have to do it. And I think to heap the burden further on the property tax, which is already strained in many of our communities, will provide, will make sh- insure, in my opinion, that many of our children will not be adequately educated, and many of our teachers not adequately compensated. There is no greater return to an economy or to a society than an educational system second to none. On the question of the development of natural resources, I would pay as you go in the sense that they would be balanced and the power revenues would bring back sufficient money to finance the projects, in the same way as the Tennessee Valley. I believe in the balanced budget. And the only conditions under which I would unbalance the budget would be if there was a grave national emergency or a serious recession. Otherwise, with a steady rate of economic growth  and Mr. Nixon and Mr. Rockefeller, in their meeting, said a five per cent economic growth would bring by 1962 ten billion dollars extra in tax revenues. Whatever is brought in, I think that we can finance essential programs within a balanced budget, if business remains orderly.",

         "Yes. I think what Mr. Novins was referring to was not one of Senator Kennedys speeches, but the Democratic platform, which did mention cutting the national debt. I think, too, that it should be pointed out that of course it is not possible, particularly under the proposals that Senator Kennedy has advocated, either to cut the national debt or to reduce taxes. As a matter of fact it will be necessary to raise taxes. As Senator Kennedy points out that as far as his one proposal is concerned  the one for medical care for the aged  that that would be financed out of Social Security. That, however, is raising taxes for those who pay Social Security. He points out that he would make pay-as-you-go be the basis for our natural resources development. Where our natural resources development  which I also support, incidentally, however  whenever you uh  uh  in  in  uh  appropriates money for one of these projects, you have to pay now and appropriate the money and the eh- while they eventually do pay out, it doesnt mean that you  the government doesnt have to put out the money this year. And so I would say that in all of these proposals Senator Kennedy has made, they will result in one of two things: either he has to raise taxes or he has to unbalance the budget. If he unbalances the budget, that means you have inflation, and that will be, of course, a very cruel blow to the very people  the older people  that weve been talking about. As far as aid for school construction is concerned, I favor that, as Senator Kennedy did, in January of this year, when he said he favored that rather than aid to s- teacher salaries. I favor that because I believe thats the best way to aid our schools without running any risk whatever of the federal government telling our teachers what to teach.",

Higher salaries for teachers, you added, were important and if the situation wasnt corrected it could lead to a national disaster.

         "Im awfully glad you ge- got that question because as you know I got into it at the last of my other question and wasnt able to complete the argument. Uh  I think that the reason that I voted against having the federal government uh  pay teachers salaries was probably the very reason that concerned Senator Kennedy when in January of this year, in his kick-off press conference, he said that he favored aid for school construction, but at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers salaries  at least thats the way I read his remarks. Now, why should there be any question about the federal government aiding s- teachers salaries? Why did Senator Kennedy take that position then? Why do I take it now? We both took it then, and I take it now, for this reason: we want higher teachers salaries. We need higher teachers salaries. But we also want our education to be free of federal control. When the federal government gets the power to pay teachers, inevitably in my opinion, it will acquire the power to set standards and to tell the teachers what to teach. I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession. There is another point that should be made. I favor higher salaries for teachers. But, as Senator Kennedy said in January of this year in this same press conference, the way that you get higher salaries for teachers is to support school construction, which means that all of the local school districts in the various states then have money which is freed to raise the standards for teachers salaries. I should also point out this; once you put the responsibility on the federal government for paying a portion of teachers salaries, your local communities and your states are not going to meet the responsibility as much as they should. I believe, in other words, that we have seen the local communities and the state assuming more of that responsibility. Teachers salaries very fortunately have gone up fifty percent in the last eight years as against only a thirty-four percent rise for other salaries. This is not enough; it should be more. But I do not believe that the way to get more salaries for teachers is to have the federal government get in with a massive program. My objection here is not the cost in dollars. My objection here is the potential cost in controls and eventual freedom for the American people by giving the federal government power over education, and that is the greatest power a government can have.",

         "When uh  the Vice President quotes me in January, sixty, I do not believe the federal government should pay directly teachers salaries, but that was not the issue before the Senate in February. The issue before the Senate was that the money would be given to the state. The state then could determine whether the money would be spent for school construction or teacher salaries. On that question the Vice President and I disagreed. I voted in favor of that proposal and supported it strongly, because I think that that provided assistance to our teachers for their salaries without any chance of federal control and it is on that vote that th- Mr. Nixon and I disagreed, and his tie vote uh  defeated his breaking the tie defeated the proposal. I dont want the federal government paying teachers salaries directly. But if the money will go to the states and the states can then determine whether it shall go for school construction or for teachers salaries, in my opinion you protect the local authority over the school board and the school committee. And therefore I think that was a sound proposal and that is why I supported it and I regret that it did not pass. Secondly, there have been statements made that uh  the Democratic platform would cost a good deal of money and that I am in favor of unbalancing the budget. That is wholly wrong, wholly in error, and it is a fact that in the last eight years the Democratic Congress has reduced the appropri- the requests for the appropriations by over ten billion dollars. That is not my view and I think it ought to be stated very clearly on the record. My view is that you can do these programs  and they should be carefully drawn  within a balanced budget if our economy is moving ahead.",

It failed because the House did not pass it and the House failed by eleven votes. And I might say that two-thirds of the Republicans in the House voted against a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage and a majority of the Democrats sustained it  nearly two-thirds of them voted for the dollar twenty-five. We were threatened by a veto if we passed a dollar and a quarter  its extremely difficult with the great power that the president does to pass any bill when the president is opposed to it. All the president needs to sustain his veto of any bill is one-third plus one in either the House or the Senate. Secondly, we passed a federal aid to education bill in the Senate. It failed to came to the floor of the House of Representatives. It was killed in the Rules Committee. And it is a fact in the August session that the four members of the Rules Committee who were Republicans joining with two Democrats voted against sending the aid to education bill to the floor of the House. Four Democrats voted for it. Every Republican on the Rules Committee voted against sending that bill to be considered by the members of the House of Representatives. Thirdly, on medical care for the aged, this is the same fight thats been going on for twenty-five years in Social Security. We wanted to tie it to Social Security. We offered an amendment to do so. Forty-four Democrats voted for it, one Republican voted for it. And we were informed at the time it came to a vote that if it was adopted the President of the United States would veto it. In my judgment, a vigorous Democratic president supported by a Democratic majority in the House and Senate can win the support for these programs. But if you send a Republican president and a Democratic majority and the threat of a veto hangs over the Congress, in my judgment you will continue what happened in the August session, which is a clash of parties and inaction.",

First of all, I dont see how its possible for a one-third of a body, such as the Republicans have in the House and the Senate to stop two-thirds, if the two-thirds are adequately led. I would say, too, that when Senator Kennedy refers to the action of the House Rules Committee, there are eight Democrats on that committee and four Republicans. It would seem to me again that it is very difficult to blame the four Republicans for the eight Democrats not getting a something through that particular committee. I would say further that to blame the President in his veto power for the inability of the Senator and his colleagues to get action in this special session uh  misses the mark. When the president exercises his veto power, he has to have the people upo- behind him, not just a third of the Congress. Because lets consider it. If the majority of the members of the Congress felt that these particular proposals were good issues  the majority of those who were Democrats  why didnt they pass them and send to the President and get a veto and have an issue? The reason why these particular bills in these various fields that have been mentioned were not passed was not because the President was against them; it was because the people were against them. It was because they were too extreme. And I am convinced that the alternate proposals that I have, that the Republicans have in the field of health, in the field of education, in the field of welfare, because they are not extreme, because they will accomplish the end uh  without too great cost in dollars or in freedom, that they could get through the next Congress.",

         "Mr. Vice President, do I take it then you believe that you can work better with Democratic majorities in the House and Senate than Senator Kennedy could work with Democratic majorities in the House and Senate? MR. NIXON; I would say this: that we, of course, expect to pick up some seats in both in the House and the Senate. Uh  We would hope to control the House, to get a majority in the House uh  in this election. We cannot, of course, control the Senate. I would say that a president will be able to lead  a president will be able to get his program through  to the effect that he has the support of the country, the support of the people. Sometimes we  we get the opinion that in getting programs through the House or the Senate its purely a question of legislative finagling and all that sort of thing. It isnt really that. Whenever a majority of the people are for a program, the House and the Senate responds to it. And whether this House and Senate, in the next session is Democratic or Republican, if the country will have voted for the candidate for the presidency and for the proposals that he has made, I believe that you will find that the president, if it were a Republican, as it would be in my case, would be able to get his program through that Congress. Now, I also say that as far as Senator Kennedys proposals are concerned, that, again, the question is not simply one of uh  a presidential veto stopping programs. You must always remember that a president cant stop anything unless he has the people behind him. And the reason President Eisenhowers vetoes have been sustained  the reason the Congress does not send up bills to him which they think will be vetoed  is because the people and the Congress, the majority of them, know the country is behind the President.",

         "Well, now lets look at these bills that the Vice President suggests were too extreme. One was a bill for a dollar twenty-five cents an hour for anyone who works in a store or company that has a million dollars a year business. I dont think thats extreme at all; and yet nearly two-thirds to three-fourths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against that proposal. Secondly was the federal aid to education bill. It  it was a very uh  because of the defeat of teacher salaries, it was not a bill that uh  met in my opinion the need. The fact of the matter is it was a bill that was less than you recommended, Mr. Nixon, this morning in your proposal. It was not an extreme bill and yet we could not get one Republican to join, at least I think four of the eight Democrats voted to send it to the floor of the House  not one Republican  and they joined with those Democrats who were opposed to it. I dont say the Democrats are united in their support of the program. But I do say a majority are. And I say a majority of the Republicans are opposed to it. The third is medical care for the aged which is tied to Social Security, which is financed out of Social Security funds. It does not put a deficit on the Treasury. The proposal advanced by you and by Mr. Javits would have cost six hundred millions of dollars  Mr. Rockefeller rejected it in New York, said he didnt agree with the financing at all, said it ought to be on Social Security. So these are three programs which are quite moderate. I think it shows the difference between the two parties. One party is ready to move in these programs. The other party gives them lip service.",

         "Mr. Smith, Mr. Nixon. In the election of 1860, Abraham Lincoln said the question was whether this nation could exist half-slave or half-free. In the election of 1960, and with the world around us, the question is whether the world will exist half-slave or half-free, whether it will move in the direction of freedom, in the direction of the road that we are taking, or whether it will move in the direction of slavery. I think it will depend in great measure upon what we do here in the United States, on the kind of society that we build, on the kind of strength that we maintain. We discuss tonight domestic issues, but I would not want that to be any implication to be given that this does not involve directly our struggle with Mr. Khrushchev for survival. Mr. Khrushchev is in New York, and he maintains the Communist offensive throughout the world because of the productive power of the Soviet Union itself. The Chinese Communists have always had a large population. But they are important and dangerous now because they are mounting a major effort within their own country. The kind of country we have here, the kind of society we have, the kind of strength we build in the United States will be the defense of freedom. If we do well here, if we meet our obligations, if were moving ahead, then I think freedom will be secure around the world. If we fail, then freedom fails. Therefore, I think the question before the American people is: Are we doing as much as we can do? Are we as strong as we should be? Are we as strong as we must be if were going to maintain our independence, and if were going to maintain and hold out the hand of friendship to those who look to us for assistance, to those who look to us for survival? I should make it very clear that I do not think were doing enough, that I am not satisfied as an American with the progress that were making. This is a great country, but I think it could be a greater country; and this is a powerful country, but I think it could be a more powerful country. Im not satisfied to have fifty percent of our steel-mill capacity unused. Im not satisfied when the United States had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world. Because economic growth means strength and vitality; it means were able to sustain our defenses; it means were able to meet our commitments abroad. Im not satisfied when we have over nine billion dollars worth of food  some of it rotting  even though there is a hungry world, and even though four million Americans wait every month for a food package from the government, which averages five cents a day per individual. I saw cases in West Virginia, here in the United States, where children took home part of their school lunch in order to feed their families because I dont think were meeting our obligations toward these Americans. Im not satisfied when the Soviet Union is turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as we are. Im not satisfied when many of our teachers are inadequately paid, or when our children go to school part-time shifts. I think we should have an educational system second to none. Im not satisfied when I see men like Jimmy Hoffa  in charge of the largest union in the United States  still free. Im not satisfied when we are failing to develop the natural resources of the United States to the fullest. Here in the United States, which developed the Tennessee Valley and which built the Grand Coulee and the other dams in the Northwest United States at the present rate of hydropower production  and that is the hallmark of an industrialized society  the Soviet Union by 1975 will be producing more power than we are. These are all the things, I think, in this country that can make our society strong, or can mean that it stands still. Im not satisfied until every American enjoys his full constitutional rights. If a Negro baby is born  and this is true also of Puerto Ricans and Mexicans in some of our cities  he has about one-half as much chance to get through high school as a white baby. He has one-third as much chance to get through college as a white student. He has about a third as much chance to be a professional man, about half as much chance to own a house. He has about uh  four times as much chance that hell be out of work in his life as the white baby. I think we can do better. I dont want the talents of any American to go to waste. I know that there are those who want to turn everything over to the government. I dont at all. I want the individuals to meet their responsibilities. And I want the states to meet their responsibilities. But I think there is also a national responsibility. The argument has been used against every piece of social legislation in the last twenty-five years. The people of the United States individually could not have developed the Tennessee Valley; collectively they could have. A cotton farmer in Georgia or a peanut farmer or a dairy farmer in Wisconsin and Minnesota, he cannot protect himself against the forces of supply and demand in the market place; but working together in effective governmental programs he can do so. Seventeen million Americans, who live over sixty-five on an average Social Security check of about seventy-eight dollars a month, theyre not able to sustain themselves individually, but they can sustain themselves through the social security system. I dont believe in big government, but I believe in effective governmental action. And I think thats the only way that the United States is going to maintain its freedom. Its the only way that were going to move ahead. I think we can do a better job. I think were going to have to do a better job if we are going to meet the responsibilities which time and events have placed upon us. We cannot turn the job over to anyone else. If the United States fails, then the whole cause of freedom fails. And I think it depends in great measure on what we do here in this country. The reason Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor in the United States. Because they felt that the American society was moving again. I want us to recapture that image. I want people in Latin America and Africa and Asia to start to look to America; to see how were doing things; to wonder what the resident of the United States is doing; and not to look at Khrushchev, or look at the Chinese Communists. That is the obligation upon our generation. In 1933, Franklin Roosevelt said in his inaugural that this generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny. I think our generation of Americans has the same rendezvous. The question now is: Can freedom be maintained under the most severe tack  attack it has ever known? I think it can be. And I think in the final analysis it depends upon what we do here. I think its time America started moving again.",

         "Mr. Smith, Senator Kennedy. The things that Senator Kennedy has said many of us can agree with. There is no question but that we cannot discuss our internal affairs in the United States without recognizing that they have a tremendous bearing on our international position. There is no question but that this nation cannot stand still; because we are in a deadly competition, a competition not only with the men in the Kremlin, but the men in Peking. Were ahead in this competition, as Senator Kennedy, I think, has implied. But when youre in a race, the only way to stay ahead is to move ahead. And I subscribe completely to the spirit that Senator Kennedy has expressed tonight, the spirit that the United States should move ahead. Where, then, do we disagree? I think we disagree on the implication of his remarks tonight and on the statements that he has made on many occasions during his campaign to the effect that the United States has been standing still. We heard tonight, for example, the statement made that our growth in national product last year was the lowest of any industrial nation in the world. Now last year, of course, was 1958. That happened to be a recession year. But when we look at the growth of G.N.P. this year, a year of recovery, we find that its six and nine-tenths per cent and one of the highest in the world today. More about that later. Looking then to this problem of how the United States should move ahead and where the United States is moving, I think it is well that we take the advice of a very famous campaigner: Lets look at the record. Is the United States standing still? Is it true that this Administration, as Senator Kennedy has charged, has been an Administration of retreat, of defeat, of stagnation? Is it true that, as far as this country is concerned, in the field of electric power, in all of the fields that he has mentioned, we have not been moving ahead. Well, we have a comparison that we can make. We have the record of the Truman Administration of seven and a half years and the seven and a half years of the Eisenhower Administration. When we compare these two records in the areas that Senator Kennedy has  has discussed tonight, I think we find that America has been moving ahead. Lets take schools. We have built more schools in these last seven and a half years than we built in the previous seven and a half, for that matter in the previous twenty years. Lets take hydroelectric power. We have developed more hydroelectric power in these seven and a half years than was developed in any previous administration in history. Let us take hospitals. We find that more have been built in this Administration than in the previous Administration. The same is true of highways. Lets put it in terms that all of us can understand. We often hear gross national product discussed and in that respect may I say that when we compare the growth in this Administration with that of the previous Administration that then there was a total growth of eleven percent over seven years; in this Administration there has been a total growth of nineteen per cent over seven years. That shows that theres been more growth in this Administration than in its predecessor. But lets not put it there; lets put it in terms of the average family. What has happened to you? We find that your wages have gone up five times as much in the Eisenhower Administration as they did in the Truman Administration. What about the prices you pay? We find that the prices you pay went up five times as much in the Truman Administration as they did in the Eisenhower Administration. Whats the net result of this? This means that the average family income went up fifteen per cent in the Eisenhower years as against two per cent in the Truman years. Now, this is not standing still. But, good as this record is, may I emphasize it isnt enough. A record is never something to stand on. Its something to build on. And in building on this record, I believe that we have the secret for progress, we know the way to progress. And I think, first of all, our own record proves that we know the way. Senator Kennedy has suggested that he believes he knows the way. I respect the sincerity which he m- which he makes that suggestion. But on the other hand, when we look at the various programs that he offers, they do not seem to be new. They seem to be simply retreads of the programs of the Truman Administration which preceded it. And I would suggest that during the course of the evening he might indicate those areas in which his programs are new, where they will mean more progress than we had then. What kind of programs are we for? We are for programs that will expand educational opportunities, that will give to all Americans their equal chance for education, for all of the things which are necessary and dear to the hearts of our people. We are for programs, in addition, which will see that our medical care for the aged are  is  are much  is much better handled than it is at the present time. Here again, may I indicate that Senator Kennedy and I are not in disagreement as to the aims. We both want to help the old people. We want to see that they do have adequate medical care. The question is the means. I think that the means that I advocate will reach that goal better than the means that he advocates. I could give better examples, but for  for whatever it is, whether its in the field of housing, or health, or medical care, or schools, or the eh- development of electric power, we have programs which we believe will move America, move her forward and build on the wonderful record that we have made over these past seven and a half years. Now, when we look at these programs, might I suggest that in evaluating them we often have a tendency to say that the test of a program is how much youre spending. I will concede that in all the areas to which I have referred Senator Kennedy would have the spe- federal government spend more than I would have it spend. I costed out the cost of the Democratic platform. It runs a minimum of thirteen and two-tenths billions dollars a year more than we are presently spending to a maximum of eighteen billion dollars a year more than were presently spending. Now the Republican platform will cost more too. It will cost a minimum of four billion dollars a year more, a maximum of four and nine-tenths billion dollar a year more than were presently spending. Now, does this mean that his program is better than ours? Not at all. Because it isnt a question of how much the federal government spends; it isnt a question of which government does the most. It is a question of which administration does the right thing. And in our case, I do believe that our programs will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million free Americans. I believe the programs that Senator Kennedy advocates will have a tendency to stifle those creative energies, I believe in other words, that his program would lead to the stagnation of the motive power that we need in this country to get progress. The final point that I would like to make is this: Senator Kennedy has suggested in his speeches that we lack compassion for the poor, for the old, and for others that are unfortunate. Let us understand throughout this campaign that his motives and mine are sincere. I know what it means to be poor. I know what it means to see people who are unemployed. I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do, but our disagreement is not about the goals for America but only about the means to reach those goals.",

The individual mandate  where you have to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance. I terminated it; its gone. Now its in court, because Obamacare is no good. But then I made a decision, Run it as well as you can  to my people, great people  Run it as well as you can. I could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy. They ran it. Premiums are down, everythings down. Heres the problem. No matter how well you run it, its no good. What wed like to do is terminate it. We have the individual mandate done. I dont know that its going to work. If we dont win, we will have to run it and well have Obamacare, but it will be better run. But it no longer is Obamacare. Because without the individual mandate, its much different. Pre-existing conditions will always stay. What I would like to do is a much better health care, much better. Well always protect people with pre-existing  so Id like to terminate Obamacare, come up with a brand new beautiful health care. The Democrats will do it because therell be tremendous pressure on them. And we might even have the House by that time. And I think were going to win the House, okay? Youll see, but I think were gonna win the House. But come up with a better health care, always protecting people with pre-existing conditions  and one thing very important. We have 180 million people out there that have great private health care, far more than were talking about with Obamacare. Joe Biden is going to terminate all of those policies. These are people that love their health care, people that have been successful  middle income people  been successful. They have 180 million plans, 180 million people, families under what he wants to do, which will basically be socialized medicine. He wont even have a choice. They want to terminate 180 million plans.

And it really is the cost, the escalating costs of health care that are inflicting such pain on working families and people across this country. And I am convinced we need to do a lot of things. We need to put health care records online. The V.A. does that. That will  that will reduce costs. We need to have more community health centers. We need to have walk-in clinics. The rise of obesity amongst young Americans is one of the most alarming statistics that there is. We should have physical fitness programs and nutrition programs in schools.

For a while, as I recall, it even seems to me that there was talk of legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana and other drugs, and I think thats all wrong. So weve seen a deterioration in values, and one of the things that I think we should do about it in terms of cause is to instill values into the young people in our schools. We got away, we got into this feeling that value- free education was the thing. And I dont believe that at all I do believe there are fundamental rights and wrongs as far as use. And, of course, as far as the how we make it better, yes, we can do better on interdiction. But weve got to do a lot better on education, and we have to do, be tougher on those who commit crimes. Weve got to get after the users more. We have to change this whole culture. You know, I saw a movie  Crocodile Dundee. And I saw the cocaine scene treated with humor, as though this was a humorous little incident. And its bad. Everybody ought to be in this thing. Entertainment industry, people involved in the schools, education. And it isnt a Republican or a Democrat or a liberal problem. But we have got to instill values in these young people. And I have put forward a many-point drug program that includes what I would do as president of the United States; in terms of doing better on interdiction; and in terms of better in the neighborhoods. But I think were all in this together, and my plea to the American people is values in the schools.",

They wonder how an elected representative uh  can serve them and participate in such activities uh  serving in the Congress of the United States. Yes, and Im certain many, many Americans were turned off by the revelations of Watergate, a very, very uh  bad period of time in American political history. Yes, and thousands, maybe millions of Americans were turned off because of the uh  problems that came out of our involvement in Vietnam. But on the other hand, I found on July fourth of this year, a new spirit born in America. We were celebrating our Bicentennial; and I find that uh  there is a  a movement as I travel around the country of greater interest in this campaign. Now, like uh  any hardworking uh  person seeking public office uh  in the campaign, inevitably sometimes you will use uh  rather graphic language and Im guilty of that just like I think most others in the political arena.

         "This is a very serious problem in our country, and it has to be dealt with. I object to that part of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill which I think is very unfair and would prove to be so. That is the part that requires employers to determine the citizenship of an employee before theyre hired. Im convinced that the result of this would be that people who are Hispanic, people who have different languages or speak with an accent, would find it difficult to be employed. I think thats wrong. Weve never had citizenship tests in our country before, and I dont think we should have a citizenship card today. That is counterproductive. I do support the other aspects of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill that strengthen enforcement at the border, strengthen other ways of dealing with undocumented workers in this difficult area and dealing with the problem of settling people who have lived here for many, many years and do not have an established status. I have further strongly recommended that this administration do something it has not done, and that is to strengthen enforcement at the border, strengthen the officials in this government that deal with undocumented workers, and to do so in a way thats responsible and within the Constitution of the United States. We need an answer to this problem, but it must be an American answer that is consistent with justice and due process. Everyone in this room, practically, here tonight, is an immigrant. We came here loving this nation, serving it, and it has served all of our most bountiful dreams. And one of those dreams is justice. And we need a measure  and I will support a measure  that brings about those objectives but avoids that one aspect that I think is very serious. The second part is to maintain and improve relations with our friends to the south. We cannot solve this problem all on our own. And thats why the failure of this administration to deal in an effective and a good-faith way with Mexico, with Costa Rica, with the other nations in trying to find a peaceful settlement to the dispute in Central America has undermined our capacity to effectively deal diplomatically in this area as well.",

         "Well, you know, Senator McCain, in the last debate and today, again, suggested that I dont understand. Its true. There are some things I dont understand. I dont understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11, while Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda are setting up base camps and safe havens to train terrorists to attack us. That was Senator McCains judgment and it was the wrong judgment. When Senator McCain was cheerleading the president to go into Iraq, he suggested it was going to be quick and easy, wed be greeted as liberators. That was the wrong judgment, and its been costly to us. So one of the difficulties with Iraq is that it has put an enormous strain, first of all, on our troops, obviously, and they have performed heroically and honorably and we owe them an extraordinary debt of gratitude. But its also put an enormous strain on our budget. Weve spent, so far, close to $700 billion and if we continue on the path that were on, as Senator McCain is suggesting, its going to go well over $1 trillion. Were spending $10 billion a month in Iraq at a time when the Iraqis have a $79 billion surplus, $79 billion. And we need that $10 billion a month here in the United States to put people back to work, to do all these wonderful things that Senator McCain suggested we should be doing, but has not yet explained how he would pay for. Now, Senator McCain and I do agree, this is the greatest nation on earth. We are a force of good in the world. But there has never been a nation in the history of the world that saw its economy decline and maintained its military superiority. And the strains that have been placed on our alliances around the world and the respect thats been diminished over the last eight years has constrained us being able to act on something like the genocide in Darfur, because we dont have the resources or the allies to do everything that we should be doing. Thats going to change when Im president, but we cant change it unless we fundamentally change Senator McCains and George Bushs foreign policy. It has not worked for America.",

So, I dont think vouchers are the right way to go. And this is not my own  only my opinion. AARP thinks that the  the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolster the system, lengthen the Medicare trust fund by eight years. Benefits were not affected at all. And ironically, if you repeal Obamacare, and I have become fond of this term, Obamacare, if you repeal it, what happens is those seniors right away are going to be paying $600 more in prescription care. Theyre now going to have to be paying copays for basic checkups that can keep them healthier. And the primary beneficiary of that repeal are insurance companies that are estimated to gain billions of dollars back when they arent making seniors any healthier. And I dont think thats the right approach when it comes to making sure that Medicare is stronger over the long term.",

         "Well, one thing I did was oppose the government takeover health care that President Clinton offered in 1993, which created 17 new taxes and 50 new bureaucracies and price controls, because we were afraid the very thing you mentioned would have happened. Everybody would have been forced into managed care. You couldnt have chosen your own doctor and that would have been the end. And I think right now we got to go back. I know theyve appointed a commission to take a look at managed care. Maybe thats part of the answer. But it seems to me if we start to take choices away from people and if we drive them into one type care, eliminate fee-for-service altogether or eliminate the fact you can go to your own doctor, you have to go somewhere else, then I think weve taken a giant step backward in the United States of America. We have the best health care delivery system in the world and we want to keep it that way. Thats why we opposed the government take over health care plan that President Clinton tried and tried and tried to get through Congress. Didnt get it done. And ended up we had more votes than he had, then they decided to pull the plug. It was a big, big mistake. Now whether or not hell do that again Ive heard some of the people say, well, thats the model we ought to use and if hes reelected maybe he will come back and try it again. I hope not. I hope not in both cases. But it does seem to me that youve raised a very important point that needs to be addressed. Youre going to have to watch it. Gonna have to take a look at all the managed care going on in California, or were going to end up losing our best care that we have in the world.",

         "Well, because I think that if the federal government moved out of the program and withdrew its supports uh  then I think you would have complete uh  economic chaos. The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall. There are hundreds of thousands of them. They really dont  theyre not able to control their market very well. They bring their crops in or their livestock in, many of them about the same time. They have only a few purchasers that buy their milk or their hogs  a few large companies in many cases  and therefore the farmer is not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place. I think the experience of the twenties has shown what a free market could do to agriculture. And if the agricultural economy collapses, then the economy of the rest of the United States sooner or later will collapse. The farmers are the number one market for the automobile industry of the United States. The automobile industry is the number one market for steel. So if the farmers economy continues to decline as sharply as it has in recent years, then I think you would have a recession in the rest of the country. So I think the case for the government intervention is a good one. Secondly, my objection to present farm policy is that there are no effective controls to bring supply and demand into better balance. The dropping of the support price in order to limit production does not work, and we now have the highest uh  surpluses  nine billion dollars worth. Weve had a uh  higher tax load from the Treasury for the farmer in the last few years with the lowest farm income in many years. I think that this farm policy has failed. In my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance. And that can only be done through governmental action. I therefore suggest that in those basic commodities which are supported, that the federal government, after endorsement by the farmers in that commodity, attempt to bring supply and demand into balance  attempt effective production controls  so that we wont have that five or six per cent surplus which breaks the price fifteen or twenty per cent. I think Mr. Bensons program has failed. And I must say, after reading the Vice Presidents speech before the farmers, as he read mine, I dont believe that its very much different from Mr. Bensons. I dont think it provides effective governmental controls. I think the support prices are tied to the average market price of the last three years, which was Mr. Bensons theory. I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future.",

I remember what the administration tried to do in 1993. They tried to have a national health care plan. And fortunately, it failed. I trust people, I dont trust the federal government. Its going to be one of the themes you hear tonight. I dont want the federal government making decisions on behalf of everybody. There is an issue with the uninsured, there sure is. And we have uninsured people in my state. Ours is a big state, a fast-growing state. We share a common border with another nation. But were providing health care for our people. One thing about insurance, thats a Washington term. The question is, are people getting health care, and we have a strong safety net, and there needs to be a safety net in America. There needs to be more community health clinics where the poor can go get health care. We need a program for the uninsured. Theyve been talking about it in Washington, D.C. The number of uninsured has now gone up for the past seven years. We need a $2,000 credit, rebate for people, working people that dont have insurance, they can get in the marketplace and start purchasing insurance. We need to have  allow small businesses to write insurance across jurisdictional lines so small business can afford health care, small restaurants can afford health care. So health care needs to be affordable and available. We have to trust people to make decisions with their lives. In the Medicare reform I talk about it says if you are a senior, you can stay in Medicare if you like it, and thats fine, but were going to give you other choices to choose if you want to do so, just like they do the federal employees. The people that work in Washington, D.C. for the U.S. Congress or the United States senate. Get a variety of choices to make in their lives. And thats what we ought to do for all people in America.",

We can’t, in the 1990s (ph), we can’t forget that. Super predators was his name. And he called it to them for 10, and they’ve taken great offense at it, and now they see it happening. But, when they see what I did for criminal justice reform and for the historically black colleges and universities, where I funded them and got them all funded, and the opportunity zones with Tim. As you know, Tim Scott was - incredible, he did a great job, a great Senator from South Carolina. He came to me with the idea and it was a great idea. It’s one of the most successful economic development acts ever in the country, opportunity zones. And the biggest beneficiary are blacks. And that’s why we have the best numbers with them in maybe ever, they’re saying ever, I read this morning, wherever, the best numbers, he has lost much of the black population because he has done a horrible job for black people. He has also done a horrible job for Hispanics. But, why do you see these millions of people pouring into our country and they’re going to take the jobs? And it’s already started.

Its a $550 billion tax scheme that will cause a big hole in the deficit which will raise interest rates and slow down the economy and cause people to pay more for home mortgages, car payments, credit card payments, college loans, and small business loans. Its not good to raise the deficit. We worked too hard to lower it. It will actually raise taxes on nine million people and, in addition to that, it will force bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment than the ones that he and Mr. Gingrich passed that I vetoed last year. So it sounds great, but our targeted tax cut for education, child rearing, healthcare and home buying, which is paid for in my balanced budget plan, something that he has not done, certified by the Congressional budget office, thats the right way to go.",

         "I think it's – I mean honestly, I think it's a tragedy that we have someone who wants to be president who has consistently over the course of his career attempted to use race to divide the American people. You know, I do believe that the vast majority of us know that we have so much more in common than what separates us. And we don't want this kind of approach that is just constantly trying to divide us, and especially by race. And let's remember how Donald Trump started. He was a, a, a—land, he owned land, he owned buildings, and he was investigated because he refused to rent property to Black families. Let's remember, this is the same individual who took out a full-page ad in The New York Times calling for the execution of five young Black and Latino boys who were innocent, the Central Park Five. Took out a full-page ad calling for their execution. This is the same individual who spread birther lies about the first Black President of the United States. And I think the American people want better than that. Want better than this. Want someone who understands as I do, I travel our country, we see in each other a friend. We see in each other a neighbor. We don't want a leader who is constantly trying to have Americans point their fingers at each other. I meet with people all the time who tell me \"Can we please just have discourse about how we're going to invest in the aspirations and the ambitions and the dreams of the American people?\" Knowing that regardless of people's color or the language their grandmother speaks we all have the same dreams and aspirations and want a president who invests in those, not in hate and division.",

         "He went on to say, Look at her. I dont think so. About another woman, he said, That wouldnt be my first choice. He attacked the woman reporter writing the story, called her disgusting, as he has called a number of women during this campaign. Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger. He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I dont think there is a woman anywhere who doesnt know what that feels like. So we now know what Donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women. Thats who Donald is. I think its really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we dont want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other, where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater.

         "The secretary said very strongly about working withweve been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyones ever seen. You look at the Middle East, its a total mess. Under your direction, to a large extent. But you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, thats another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly. They were choking on the sanctions. And now theyre going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way theyre going. But when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO? And you have to understand, Im a businessperson. I did really well. But I have common sense. And I said, well, Ill tell you. I havent given lots of thought to NATO. But two things. Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them arent paying their fair share. Number twoand that bothers me, because we should be askingwere defending them, and they should at least be paying us what theyre supposed to be paying by treaty and contract. And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, becauseand I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honestbut I said, they do not focus on terror. And I was very strong. And I said it numerous times. And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division. And I think thats great. And I think we should getbecause we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO. Its a lot of money to protect other people. But Im all for NATO. But I said they have to focus on terror, also. And theyre going to do that.

         "As a matter of reality, Fm going to have to because we have had not one but two detailed studies which indicate that there are billions and billions of dollars to be collected that are not being paid these are not taxes owed by average Americans. We dont have an alternative. Well lose it when its taken out of our paycheck before we even get it. But its the Internal Revenue Service which estimates now that we arent collecting $100 billion or more in taxes owed in this country. And that is just absolutely unfair to the vast majority of Americans who pay their taxes and pay them on time. The Dorgan Task Force, which included two internal revenue commissioners, one a Republican, one a Democrat. It was a bipartisan commission, a study by two respected economists, which indicated that we could collect some 40, 45, 50 billion dollars of those funds. The point is youve got to have a president whos prepared to do this and to begin right away and, preferably, a president who was a governor of a state thats had very, very successful experience at doing this. In my own state, we did it. In other states, weve done it. Republican governors as well as Democratic governors. And weve had great success at revenue enforcement. Now, the Vice President will probably tell you that its going to take an army of IRS collectors again. Well, his campaign manager, who used to be the secretary of the treasury, was taking great credit about a year ago and asking and receiving from the Congress substantial additional funds to hire internal revenue agents to go out and collect these funds, and Im happy to join Jim Baker in saying that we agree on this. But, the fact of the matter is that this is something that we must begin its going to take at least the first year of the new administration. But, the Dorgan Task Force, the bipartisan task force estimated that we could collect about $35 billion in the fifth year, $105 billion over five years, the other study even more than that",

Criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones with Tim Scott, a great senator from South Carolina. He came in with this incredible idea for opportunity zones. Its one of the most successful programs. People dont talk about it. Tremendous investment is being made. Biggest beneficiary, the Black and Hispanic communities and then historically Black colleges and universities. After three years of coming to the office, I love some of those guys, they were great, they came into the office. And they said I said, What are you doing after three years? I said, Why do you keep coming back? Because we have no funding. I said, You dont have to come back every year, We have to come back, because President Obama would never give them long term funding. And I did. Ten-year, long term funding, and I gave them more money than they asked for, because I said, I think you need more.

The problem with Mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS who they felt were in Mosul. About three months ago, I started reading that they want to get the leaders and theyre going to attack Mosul. Whatever happened to the element of surprise, OK? We announce were going after Mosul. I have been reading about going after Mosul now for abouthow long is it, Hillary, three months? These people have all left. Theyve all left. The element of surprise. Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country. So were now fighting for Mosul, that we had. All she had to do was stay there, and now were going in to get it. But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it? And the only reason they did it is because shes running for the office of president and they want to look tough. They want to look good. He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all mistakes. Thats why we have the great migration. But she wanted to look good for the election. So theyre going in. But whos going to get Mosul, really? Well take Mosul eventually. But the wayif you look at whats happening, much tougher than they thought. Much, much tougher. Much more dangerous. Going to be more deaths that they thought. But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because theyre smart. They say, what do we need this for? So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing. And Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupidthe stupidest deal of all time, a deal thats going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons. Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much, because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something theyve wanted to do forever, but weve made it so easy for them. So were now going to take Mosul. And you know whos going to be the beneficiary? Iran. Oh, yeah, theyre makingI mean, they are outsmartinglook, youre not there, you might be involved in that decision.

He keeps saying, Look, Ive created 5 million jobs. Thats after losing 5 million jobs. The entire record is such that the unemployment has not been reduced in this country. The unemployment, the number of people who are still looking for work, is still 23 million Americans. There are more people in poverty, one out of six people in poverty. How about food stamps? When he took office, 32 million people were on food stamps. Today, 47 million people are on food stamps. How about the growth of the economy? Its growing more slowly this year than last year, and more slowly last year than the year before. The president wants to do well. I understand. But the policies hes put in place from Obamacare to Dodd-Frank to his tax policies to his regulatory policies, these policies combined have not let this economy take off and grow like it could have. You might say, Well, you got an example of one that worked better? Yeah, in the Reagan recession where unemployment hit 10.8 percent, between that period  the end of that recession and the equivalent of time to today, Ronald Reagans recovery created twice as many jobs as this presidents recovery. Five million jobs doesnt even keep up with our population growth. And the only reason the unemployment rate seems a little lower today is because of all the people that have dropped out of the workforce. The president has tried, but his policies havent worked. Hes great as a  as a  as a speaker and describing his plans and his vision. Thats wonderful, except we have a record to look at. And that record shows he just hasnt been able to cut the deficit, to put in place reforms for Medicare and Social Security to preserve them, to get us the rising incomes we need. Median income is down $4,300 a family and 23 million Americans out of work. Thats what this election is about.

That would obviously be a ridiculous thing for anyone to do who wanted to be president of this country. I think that this is uh  an instance of uh  deliberate distortion, and this has occurred also in the question about defense. As a matter of fact, uh  Ive never advocated any cut of $15 billion in our defense budget. As a matter of fact, Mr. Ford has made a political football out of the defense budget. About a year ago he cut the Pentagon budget six point eight billion dollars. After he fired James Schlesinger, the political heat got so great that he added back about $3 billion. When Ronald Reagan won the Texas primary election, Mr. Ford added back another one and a half billion dollars. Immediately before the Kansas City convention, he added back another one point eight billion dollars in the defense budget. And his own uh  Office of Management and Budget testified that he had a $3 billion cut insurance added to the defense budget  defense budget under the pressure from the Pentagon. Obviously, this is another indication of trying to use the defense budget for political purposes, which hes trying to do tonight. Now, we went into south Africa late, after Great Britain, Rhodesia, the black nations had been trying to solve this problem for many, many years. We didnt go in until right before the election, similar to what was taking place in 1972, when Mr. Kissinger announced peace is at hand just before the election at that time.

It is well known he exchanged love letters with Kim Jong un.

         "I would hope I never have to. I understand how hard it is to commit troops. Never wanted to commit troops. When I was running  when we had the debate in 2000, never dreamt Id be doing that. But the enemy attacked us, Jim, and I have a solemn duty to protect the American people, to do everything I can to protect us. I think that by speaking clearly and doing what we say and not sending mixed messages, it is less likely well ever have to use troops. But a president must always be willing to use troops. It must  as a last resort. I was hopeful diplomacy would work in Iraq. It was falling apart. There was no doubt in my mind that Saddam Hussein was hoping that the world would turn a blind eye. And if he had been in power, in other words, if we would have said, Let the inspectors work, or lets, you know, hope to talk him out. Maybe an 18th resolution would work, he would have been stronger and tougher, and the world would have been a lot worse off. Theres just no doubt in my mind we would rue the day, had Saddam Hussein been in power. So we use diplomacy every chance we get, believe me. And I would hope to never have to use force. But by speaking clearly and sending messages that we mean what we say, weve affected the world in a positive way. Look at Libya. Libya was a threat. Libya is now peacefully dismantling its weapons programs. Libya understood that America and others will enforce doctrine and that the world is better for it. So to answer your question, I would hope we never have to. I think by acting firmly and decisively, it will mean it is less likely we have to use force.",

         "I dont think a president can do that. I was disappointed in the ruling because I think abortions ought to be more rare in America, and Im worried that that pill will create more abortions and cause more people to have abortions. This is a very important topic and its a very sensitive topic, because a lot of good people disagree on the issue. I think what the next president ought to do is to promote a culture of life in America. Life of the elderly and life of those living all across the country. Life of the unborn. As a matter of fact, I think a noble goal for this country is that every child, born or unborn, need to be protected by law and welcomed to life. I know we need to change a lot of minds before we get there in America. What I do believe is that we can find good, common ground on issues of parental consent or parental notification. I know we need to ban partial birth abortions. This is a place where my opponent and I have strong disagreement. I believe banning partial birth abortions would be a positive step to reducing the number of abortions in America. This is an issue that will require a new attitude. Weve been battling over abortion for a long period of time. Surely this nation can come together to promote the value of life. Surely we can fight off these laws that will encourage doctors to  to allow doctors to take the lives of our seniors. Surely we can work together to create a cultural life so some of these youngsters who feel like they can take a neighbors life with a gun will understand that thats not the way America is meant to be. Surely we can find common ground to reduce the number of abortions in America. As to the drug itself, I mentioned I was disappointed. I hope the FDA took its time to make sure that American women will be safe who use this drug.",

There was one good thing that came out of that budget agreement, and that is we put a cap on discretionary spending. One-third of the presidents budget is at the presidents discretion, or really the Congress, since they appropriate every dime and tell a president how to spend every dime. Weve put a cap on the growth of all that spending, and thats good and thats helped. But I was wrong because I thought the tax compromise, going along with 1 Democratic tax increase, would help the economy. I see no evidence that it has done it. So what would I have done? What should I have done? I should have held out for a better deal that would have protected the taxpayer and not ended up doing what we had to do, or what I thought at the time would help. So I made a mistake, and I  you know, the difference, I think, is that I knew at the time I was going to take a lot of political flak. I knew wed have somebody out there yelling read my lips, and I did it because I thought it was right. And I made a mistake.

Uh  let me uh  talk about uh  the economic announcements that were made just this past week. Yes, it was announced that the uh  GNP real growth in the third quarter was at 4 percent. But do you realize that over the last ten years thats a higher figure than the average growth during that ten-year period? Now its lower than the nine-point-point-two percent growth in the first quarter, and its lower than the uh 5 percent growth in the second quarter. But every economist  liberal, conservative that Im familiar with  recognizes that in the fourth quarter of this year and in the fifth quar- uh  the first quarter of next year that well have an increase in real GNP. But now lets talk about the pluses that came out this week. We had an 18 percent increase in housing starts. We had a substantial increase in new permits for housing. As a matter of fact, based on the announcement this week, there will be at an annual rate of a million, eight hundred and some thousand new houses built, which is a tremendous increase over last year and a substantial increase over the earlier part of this year. Now in addition, we had a very  some very good news in the reduction in the rate of inflation. And inflation hits everybody: those who are working and those who are on welfare. The rate of inflation, as announced just the other day, is under 5 percent; and the uh  4.4 percent that was indicated at the time of the 4 percent GNP was less than the 5.4 percent. It means that the American buyer is getting a better bargain today because inflation is less.",

         "Gosh, I sure hope its not the administration. Theres a  no, look, theres a systemic problem. Health-care costs are on the rise because the consumers are not involved in the decision-making process. Most health-care costs are covered by third parties. And therefore, the actual user of health care is not the purchaser of health care. And theres no market forces involved with health care. Its one of the reasons Im a strong believer in what they call health savings accounts. These are accounts that allow somebody to buy a low-premium, high-deductible catastrophic plan and couple it with tax-free savings. Businesses can contribute, employees can contribute on a contractual basis. But this is a way to make sure people are actually involved with the decision-making process on health care. Secondly, I do believe the lawsuits  I dont believe, I know  that the lawsuits are causing health-care costs to rise in America. Thats why Im such a strong believer in medical liability reform. In the last debate, my opponent said those lawsuits only caused the cost to go up by 1 percent. Well, he didnt include the defensive practice of medicine that costs the federal government some $28 billion a year and costs our society between $60 billion and $100 billion a year. Thirdly, one of the reasons why theres still high cost in medicine is because this is  they dont use any information technology. Its like if you looked at the  its the equivalent of the buggy and horse days, compared to other industries here in America. And so, weve got to introduce high technology into health care. Were beginning to do it. Were changing the language. We want there to be electronic medical records to cut down on error, as well as reduce cost. People tell me that when the health-care field is fully integrated with information technology, itll wring some 20 percent of the cost out of the system. And finally, moving generic drugs to the market quicker. And so, those are four ways to help control the costs in health care.",

You were after him, you were trying toyou even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures. I dont think you can deny that. But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true. So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesnt work. It really doesnt. Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my fathers company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the countryit was a federal lawsuitwere sued. We settled the suit with zerowith no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do. But they sued many people. I notice you bring that up a lot. And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I dont do on you. Maybe Im trying to save the money. But, frankly, I lookI look at that, and I say, isnt that amazing? Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and its just one of those things. Ill go one step further. In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it. No discrimination against African-Americans, against Muslims, against anybody. And its a tremendously successful club. And Im so glad I did it. And I have been given great credit for what I did.

So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation. Weve never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election. We have 1717 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election.

And Im a big proponent. Were going to do a lot of things for college tuition. But the rest of the publics going to be paying for it. We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clintons plan. She immediatelywhen she heard this, I questioned it, and I questioned NATO. Why arent the NATO questionedwhy arent they paying? Because they werent paying. Since I did thisthis was a year agoall of a sudden, theyre paying. And Ive been given a lota lot of credit for it. All of a sudden, theyre starting to pay up. They have to pay up. Were protecting people, they have to pay up. And Im a big fan of NATO. But they have to pay up. She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great. Well, its awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are. We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out.

You look at all of the places that I just left, you go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them. You go upstate New York.

I vetoed the strip-mining bill, Mr. Kraft, because it was the overwhelming consensus of knowledgeable people that that strip-mining bill would have meant the loss of literally uh  thousands of jobs, something around a hundred and forty thousand jabs. Number two, that strip-mining bill wouldve severely set back our need for more coal, and Governor Carter has said repeatedly that coal is the resource that we need to use more in the effort to become independent of the uh  Arab oil supply. So, I vetoed it because of a loss of jobs and because it wouldve interfered with our energy independence program. The auto emissions  uh  it was agreed by Leonard Woodcock, the head of the UAW, and by the uh  heads of all of the automobile industry, we had labor and management together saying that those auto emission standards had to be modified. But lets talk about what the Ford administration has done in the field of environment. I have increased, as president, by over 60 percent the funding for water treatment plants in the United States, the federal contribution. I have fully funded the land and water conservation program; in fact, have recommended and the Congress approved a substantially increased land and water conservation program. Uh  I have uh  added in the current year budget the funds for the National Park Service. For example, we uh  proposed about $12 million to add between four and five hundred more employees for the National Park Service. And a month or so ago I did uh  likewise say over the next ten years we should expand  double  this national parks, the wild wilderness areas, the scenic river areas.

And shes going after fact after fact, and shes lying again, because she said sheyou know, what she did with the e-mails was fine. You think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails? I dont think so. She said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughters wedding, number one, and a yoga class. Well, maybe well give three or three or four or five or something. 33,000 e-mails deleted, and now shes saying there wasnt anything wrong. And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena. That wasnt before. That was after. She got it from the United States Congress. And Ill be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen. Our Justice Department, where her husband goes onto the back of an airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case. But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself. What you didand this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.",
